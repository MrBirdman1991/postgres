## What is SQL

SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it is needed to communicate with data in a database. SQL is a relational database language.  Besides SQL there are also non-relational database languages like MongoDB for example.

> SQL is typically used for managing data in relational database management systems (RDBMS). In these, data can be stored in a tabular structure. Individual tables can in turn be linked to each other.
